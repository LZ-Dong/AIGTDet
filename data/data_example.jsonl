{"article": "The National Weather Service\u2019s Mike McFarland advises that Western Washington will be experiencing cold weather for the next few days, which is normal after a couple of mild winters. El Nino conditions typically result in mild winters; however, the weak La Nina, neutral conditions may bring about normal winters and cold snaps.\n\nDespite Seattle's anticipated freezing temperatures, with highs ranging from 20s to low 30s, McFarland says the temperatures will gradually increase as the week continues. In areas north of Seattle, including Whatcom and Skagit counties, temperatures could drop even further with the wind chill factor. The Weather Service has issued a Wind Advisory for Monday morning, noting that sustained winds of 20 to 35 mph and gusts as high as 50 mph are making for wind chill readings in the single digits.\n\nSeattle may see some rain and snow later in the week, but moisture is expected to be limited. The city is expected to stay mostly dry until Saturday when temperatures start to rise.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, 2016 will be remembered in the climate record \u201chall of fame\u201d with Seattle experiencing the coldest December month and the warmest April and November on record. The three previous years: 2014, 2015, and 2016 saw the largest year-on-year changes in temperature since the 1890s. In December 2016, Seattle was only one degree warmer than December 2008, but unlike in 2008, the city did not experience two consecutive weeks of snow on the ground.", "label": "chatgpt",
